# Mushroom_Hide_Game

Hide from the monster and get to the other side! This is the game I produced for my CGRA151 course at Victoria University of Wellington, all art and functionality is my own. It is a stealth game set in a forest where you play as a mushroom creature that has to get to the other side of the forest, whilst avoiding obstacles and the monster that is searching for you.
